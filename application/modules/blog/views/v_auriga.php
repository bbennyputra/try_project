                 The Technology Training Portal offers digital e-learning solutions to UN Mission ICT professionals and
                 other end-users, responding to the needs of both civilian staff and uniformed personnel.
             </p>
             <p>
                 The entire community of peacekeeping missions can benefit from the Technology Training Portal. Mission
                 Staff can build and enhance their technology skills “anytime, anywhere” through these e-learning
                 programs, which are organized into a single course or in learning paths and tailored to the specific UN
                 Staff requirements.
             </p>
             <p>
                 The platform will be periodically populated with new relevant content to better respond to the
                 learner’s new expectations and needs.
             </p>

                         The different courses categories are available in the portal landing page, providing quick
                         access to different learning programs. Each learning program contains all the pre-planned,
                         role-based learning activities in the form of self-paced courses and virtual and/or
                         classroom-based events.

                     <p>
                         The Portal also lists external courses in an effort to become the "one stop shop" for training.
                         Users will be requested to upload their certificates, after external course completion, to the
                         Portal. This will facilitate future reference and optimize training management. Detailed info
                         will be available at each course.
